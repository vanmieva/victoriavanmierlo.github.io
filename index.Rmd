  <p>Hi, I'm Victoria. Welcome to my page!</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>I am a Doctoral Student at McGill University who possesses a broad skillset and believes in applying a comprehensive and inclusive approach to research. My passion is to generate practical and applicable knowledge about aquatic invasive species that contributes to positive ecological and legislative change. </p>

  <p>My current focus is on understanding and addressing the decline of freshwater biodiversity by examining the impacts of biological invasions. I look at the where, why, and how of invasive crayfishes in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin using field, lab, and modeling techniques. I work closely with my supervisor [Dr. Anthony Ricciardi](https://redpath-staff.mcgill.ca/ricciardi/index.html) and my network of talented colleagues. </p>
