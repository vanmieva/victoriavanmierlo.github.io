My doctoral research program, under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Ricciardi at McGill University, aims to understand and address the decline of freshwater biodiversity by examining the impacts of biological invasions. I am interested in understanding the where, why, and how of invasive crayfishes in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin. I use field surveys, laboratory experiments, and statistical modeling to determine which water bodies are most vulnerable to invasion and how the expected and realized invasive ranges and impacts may change as climate change progresses. I am also interested in how invasive crayfishes compare competitively to native crayfishes of the region. 

By providing essential data for risk assessment and evaluating management strategies, my research seeks to protect the rich biodiversity of the Great Lakes basin from current and emerging invasive threats.

This work is supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through the Canada Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral (CGS D) and by the the McGill Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies Fellowships Committee through the 2024/25 Richard H. Tomlinson Doctoral Fellowship.

From 2022 to 2024, I had the privilege of working as a federal public servant with the Canadian Wildlife Service - Ontario Region, focusing on addressing biodiversity related information gaps in Far Northern Ontario, part of Treaty 9 territory, the traditional lands of the Anishnaabeg, Oji-Cree, Omushkegowuk, and Métis Peoples (Leslie 2020). Far Northern Ontario is composed of vast peatlands and old-growth conifer stands that support several Species at Risk, including boreal and eastern migratory caribou (Hornseth & Rempel 2016; Magoun et al. 2005). It is also home to The Ring of Fire (RoF), a large area within the Hudson Plains ecoregion that is rich in critical minerals for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing. A regional assessment regarding the potential impacts of mineral extraction from the RoF has been announced, and the [draft terms of agreement](https://iaac-aeic.gc.ca/050/evaluations/proj/80468?culture=en-CA) were published in September 2024. As a Wildlife Habitat Biologist, my role was broad and fulfilling, supporting the collection of baseline ecological information in Far Northern Ontario with a particular focus on boreal caribou predators - specifically grey wolf vocalization analysis and modeling. During this time, I developed and applied skills in geospatial analysis using ArcGIS Pro, Bayesian statistical modeling and power analysis, information management, procurement, as well as student hiring and supervision.

### Occupancy & impacts of Northern Crayfish (*Faxonius virilis*) in tributaries of in the North Saskatchewan River basin (M.Sc Research)

From 2019 to 2021, I conducted research on the occupancy and impacts of invasive Northern Crayfish (*Faxonius virilis*) in the North Saskatchewan River basin. My work was nested within the larger North Saskatchewan River watershed integrity and aquatic ecosystem health project - a partnership between the University of Alberta, Alberta Innovates Water Innovation Program, the Government of Alberta, and EPCOR. To read more about the watershed integrity project, please visit this [summary](https://albertainnovates.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/222301756-Development-of-a-Comprehensive-Geospatial-Tool-Proj-Summ-Apr-4-2023.pdf). Through this work, I earned my Master of Science under the supervision of my committee members (Dr. Stephanie Green, Dr. Mark Poesch, and Dr. Craig Emmerton) and published my first peer-reviewed publication [(Van Mierlo et al, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1086/722576). During this time, I planned and conducted field work to sample and collect invasive crayfish and native fishes in tributaries of the prairie, mid-land, and rocky mountain regions of the watershed. The resulting data was first used to determined the in-stream environmental characteristics most associated with the crayfish’s occupancy in the NSR and determine which unoccupied tributaries are most prone to crayfish invasion. Ultimately, my findings indicated that water temperature alone drove occupancy of *F. virilis* in the NSR and that tributaries with mean summer water temperatures greater than 18.7 °C having a 50% + likelihood to be occupied by *F. virilis* and thus, are at highest risk for subsequent invasion. With these results, I was able to provide practical guidelines for watershed management of invasive *F. virilis* populations in the NSR and Alberta.

Additionally, I used stable isotope analysis to investigate if *F. virilis* sympatry was related to differences in isotopic characteristics and/or reduced condition of native fishes. My results suggested that *F. virilis* may be utilizing dietary plasticity to exploit a slightly different trophic niche than native fishes and in doing so, avoid exploitative competition for nutritional resources. Dietary plasticity may be facilitate the establishment and invasion of *F. virilis* populations in unoccupied tributaries of the NSR where *F. virilis* could be negatively affecting rare/sensitive fish species through indirect or direct forms of competition.
