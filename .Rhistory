textblock1 = "My doctoral research program, under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Ricciardi, will focus on addressing the decline of freshwater biodiversity by examining the impacts of biological invasions. Marbled crayfish have recently been found for the first-time outside aquaria in the Great Lakes basin, a critical ecosystem supporting over 9 million Canadians and a $7 billion dollar (USD) fishery. This crayfish, known for its unique asexual reproduction and rapid growth, has successfully invaded and exerted negative effects in multiple continents and is now establishing itself in Canadian waters. My research aims are three-fold; first, to identify the areas that are most vulnerable to marbled crayfish invasion so these waterbodies can be prioritized for preventative measures; second, to understand the marbled crayfish's potential consequences on native freshwater species by measuring their resource consumption rate, survival, and growth compared to native crayfish species; and third, to investigate the effectiveness of functional eradication as a management strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of established invasive marbled crayfish populations. By providing essential data for risk assessment and evaluating management strategies, my research seeks to protect the rich biodiversity of the Great Lakes basin from emerging invasive threats such as the marbled crayfish."
