textblock1 = "My doctoral research program, under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Ricciardi, will focus on addressing the decline of freshwater biodiversity by examining the impacts of biological invasions. Marbled crayfish have recently been found for the first-time outside aquaria in the Great Lakes basin, a critical ecosystem supporting over 9 million Canadians and a $7 billion dollar (USD) fishery. This crayfish, known for its unique asexual reproduction and rapid growth, has successfully invaded and exerted negative effects in multiple continents and is now establishing itself in Canadian waters. My research aims are three-fold; first, to identify the areas that are most vulnerable to marbled crayfish invasion so these waterbodies can be prioritized for preventative measures; second, to understand the marbled crayfish's potential consequences on native freshwater species by measuring their resource consumption rate, survival, and growth compared to native crayfish species; and third, to investigate the effectiveness of functional eradication as a management strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of established invasive marbled crayfish populations. By providing essential data for risk assessment and evaluating management strategies, my research seeks to protect the rich biodiversity of the Great Lakes basin from emerging invasive threats such as the marbled crayfish."

#### 3. Check heterogeneity assumption for ANOVAs ####
# data is normally distributed - see section 1
# check variances are equal
leveneTest(ag_temp ~ species, data = ct) # insignif = equal variances - good check.
leveneTest(ag_temp ~ acclim_temp, data = ct) # insignif = equal variances - good check.
leveneTest(loe_temp ~ species, data = ct) # insignif  = equal variances - good check.
leveneTest(loe_temp ~ acclim_temp, data = ct) # signif = UNequal variances - check 4times rule of thumb - below.
leveneTest(TempToCTMax ~ species, data = ct) # insignif (but barely) = equal variances - good check.
leveneTest(TempToCTMax ~ acclim_temp, data = ct) # insignif  = equal variances - good check.
# ANOVA is robust to heterogeneity if it is minor.
# minor heterogeneity variance rule of thumb is that the largest group variance can be up
# to four times the smallest without posing strong problems.
# See here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/28601/how-to-run-two-way-anova-on-data-with-neither-normality-nor-equality-of-variance
# check this below.
ct %>%
group_by(species, acclim_temp) %>%
summarise(var_ag_temp = var(ag_temp, na.rm = TRUE))
# variance of Vir18 is more than 4 times greater than the smallest group variance, but
# levene test is insignif, so good to move forward.
ct %>%
group_by(species, acclim_temp) %>%
summarise(var_loe_temp = var(loe_temp, na.rm = TRUE))
0.713/4 # = 0.17825
# largest group variance (vir18 = 0.713) is almost exactly 4x larger than smallest group variance (lim24 = 0.171)
# so. good to move forward.
ct %>%
group_by(species, acclim_temp) %>%
summarise(var_win_temp = var(TempToCTMax, na.rm = TRUE))
# again, variance of Vir18 is more than 4 times greater than the smallest group variance, but
# levene test is insignif, so good to move forward.
## conclusion:  good to run a two-way anova - but look for any warning messages.
#### 4. Two way ANOVAs (3+ treatments) ####
## Run two way anova (acclim temp and species) - see: https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/two-way-anova-test-in-r
## Agitation temperature
# compute ANOVA
ag_aov <- aov(ag_temp ~ species + acclim_temp,
data = ct) # note:  "+" assumes variables are independent, "*" assumes variables are synergistic.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # combine plots
# histogram
hist(ag_aov$residuals) # normal, good check
# QQ-plot
qqPlot(ag_aov$residuals, # within boundaries - good check.
id = FALSE # id = FALSE to remove point identification
)
shapiro.test(ag_aov$residuals) #signif = bad check, indicates non-normality which I find strange since the hit and qq look good.
summary(ag_aov)
report(ag_aov) # interpretation: acclimation temp has significant effect on agitation temp while species does not.
## CTmax temperature
# compute ANOVA
ctm_aov <- aov(loe_temp ~ species+ acclim_temp,
data = ct)
# Check residuals
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # combine plots
# histogram
hist(ctm_aov$residuals) # normal, good check
# QQ-plot
qqPlot(ctm_aov$residuals, # wihtin boundaries - good check.
id = FALSE # id = FALSE to remove point identification
)
shapiro.test(ctm_aov$residuals) #insignf = good check.
summary(ctm_aov)
report(ctm_aov) # interpretation: acclimation temp has significant effect on CTmax while species does not.
## CTmax window
# compute ANOVA
win_aov <- aov(TempToCTMax ~ species+ acclim_temp,
data = ct)
# Check residuals
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # combine plots
# histogram
hist(win_aov$residuals) # normal, good check
# QQ-plot
qqPlot(win_aov$residuals, # mostyl within boundaries but tappers near ends quite a bit - hceck shapiro
id = FALSE # id = FALSE to remove point identification
)
shapiro.test(win_aov$residuals) #significant = bad check, indicates non-normality
summary(ctm_aov)
report(ctm_aov) # interpretation: acclimation temp has significant effect on window while species does not.
## ANOVAs indicate significatn differences for acclimation temp but no significant differences between species groups
## for ag_temp, CTmax, and CTmax window.
## These analyses, of course, do not include body size, trial, or position as a random variables.
## Need to run LMM for this.  See next section.
